# Data Preprocessing Pipeline
# Overview
This Python script implements a data preprocessing pipeline using the Pandas library and scikit-learn. The purpose of the pipeline is to prepare a dataset for machine learning tasks by handling missing values, detecting and handling outliers, and normalizing numeric features.

# Dependencies
Pandas
NumPy
scikit-learn
Make sure to install the required dependencies using:

bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

# Usage
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
Place your dataset in a CSV file named data.csv in the same directory as the script.
Run the script.
python
python preprocessing_pipeline.py
# Preprocessing Steps
## Identify Features:
- **Numeric features:** Identified using the `select_dtypes` method for float and integer types.
- **Categorical features:** Identified using the `select_dtypes` method for object types.
## Handle Missing Values in Numeric Features:
- Missing values in numeric features are filled with the mean of the respective columns.
## Detect and Handle Outliers in Numeric Features:
- Outliers in numeric features are detected using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
- Outliers are replaced with the mean of the respective columns.
## Normalize Numeric Features:
- Numeric features are standardized using the Standard Scaler from scikit-learn.
## Handle Missing Values in Categorical Features:
- Missing values in categorical features are filled with the mode (most frequent value) of the respective columns.
## Output:

- The processed dataset is displayed in the console.

Example

python

import pandas as pd

from preprocessing_pipeline import data_ppr_pipeline

Read the dataset

data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

Apply the preprocessing pipeline

processed_data = data_ppr_pipeline(data)

Display the processed data

print("Processed Data:")

print(processed_data)
# Notes
1. This script assumes the input dataset is in CSV format and follows the standard conventions of data representation.
2. Ensure that the column types in your dataset match the assumptions made in the script (numeric features: float or int, categorical features: object).
